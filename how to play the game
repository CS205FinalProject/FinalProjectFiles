How to play rat-a-cat-tat
Objective
•	To have the lowest score at the end of the game
Three Game types
•	Play for a certain number of rounds
•	Play for a specific length of time
•	Play to stay in the game and not reach 100 points. When a player reaches 100 points he is out of the game. The last player in the game is the winner. You can play up to any number of points.
The setup
•	Choose one player to be the dealer and another to be the scorekeeper
•	The scorekeeper records each players score at the end of each round
•	Shuffle the deck
•	The dealer deals four cards, one at a time face down to each player
•	The remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table as the draw pile
•	The top card of the draw pile is turned over to start the discard pile
o	If the card is a power card, it is placed back in the deck and another card is turned over
•	Each player will then place his/her four cards in front of themselves face down in a line
Starting the game
•	to begin the game each player peeks at their two outermost cards ONCE and then turns them face down again. You cannot look at these cards again. You must remember them and if you don’t, you don’t.
•	if one of the outer cards for a player is a power card, you keep them, but they don’t have their power value. You want to get rid of your power card ASAP
•	Power cards only have their powers when they are drawn from the top of the draw pile.
•	The player to the left of the dealer has the first turn, continuing in a clockwise direction.
The turns
•	For each turn a player has the following two options:
o	Draw the top card from the discard pile. This card MUST be used to replace one of his or her cards. The card is replaced is then put faceup on the discard pile
o	OR the player may take a card from the top of the draw pile and replace with one of his/her cards
o	Discard it face up to the discard pile
o	Peek, swap, or draw 2 if it is a power card (see below for instructions on power cards)
Power cards
•	Peek
o	When you draw a peek from the draw pile show it to everyone and you then are allowed to peek at any one of your cards. You will either know 3 of 4 cards now or you can refresh your memory incase you have forgotten one of your outer cards. Then discard to discard pile face up
•	Swap	
o	Show the swap card and discard it. You may now switch any one of your cards with any card of another player (Swapping is optional). 
o	You cannot look at your card, or at the card you are getting. After the swap your turn is over
•	Draw 2
o	Show the card, discard it and you receive two more turns.
o	You draw the first card from the draw pile. You must decide whether to use this card and forfeit the second turn OR discard this card and draw a second card. The second card can be used or discarded.
Ending the round
•	When a player thinks he has the lowest score and can win the round, they may end the round by knocking on the table and say “rat-a-tat-cat” at the end of his turn. Once he knocks, every other player has one more turn. Each player then turns over his cards. Players replace all power cards by drawing from the draw pile. If another power card is drawn, the player draws again.
Scoring
•	Players add the point values of their four cards. This is each player’s score for the round. He scorekeeper records each player’s score. Lowest score wins
Next rounds
•	All cards are collected and passed to the player to the left of the dealer who then reshuffles and deals for next round
